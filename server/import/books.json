I love Nakika and her smiles so much. Love ch 5.5. \n Just found out that it was cancelled and next week is the final chapter. This makes me sad like you can’t even believe. \n It’s about this girl who’s pursuing this guy and this other girl is helping her and omg holy shit the girls’ relationship is so peak and Nakika is so pretty and cool and I love her so much. And the guy was so bland but there were hints of yuri and the hints have been getting stronger especially with chapter 36, so I scavenged for anyone discussing it and find out it was cancelled ahhsakdahjsd \n Legit so good so sad that it was cancelled",

Also, the other invokes the we can’t be together because of x societal circumstances trope in the flashback scenes, which I love — sort of was doomed but not anymore yuri which makes me happy",
